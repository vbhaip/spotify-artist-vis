## Spotify Artist Visualization

This repository contains the code for this post: [https://vinaybhaip.com/blog/2020/08/22/spotify-artist-viz](https://vinaybhaip.com/blog/2020/08/22/spotify-artist-viz). The project gives a visual walkthrough on my listening patterns using the streaming data (excluded from the repo) that Spotify provides.

I built this using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [Scrollama](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama).

Note, this project varies slightly from the code used in the blogpost to account for formatting, but the underlying code is the same.
