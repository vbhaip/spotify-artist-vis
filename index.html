			<p>I recently uncovered my Spotify data documenting every song I've listened to for the past two years. Let's dive in.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step='1'>
			<p>This figure displays the cumulative time I spent listening to each artist's music. The artists I listen to fall into three tiers.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step='1.1'>
			<p>At the top of the list (with nearly 50 hours each!) are Drake and J. Cole. Personally, my favorite artist is J. Cole and I listen to a lot of the mainstream Drake songs, so this makes sense. No surprises here. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step='1.2'>
			<p>Kanye, Maroon 5, and Post Malone round up tier 2 at about 25 hours a piece. I'm surprised with Post Malone's appearance here&mdash;I didn't realize I listened to him <i>that</i> much.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step='1.3'>
			<p>And the rest trail behind below 20 hours marker (Juice WRLD and Kendrick are close though!). It's worth pointing out that one of these artists is actually a podcast&mdash;Hello Internet.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step='1.4'>
			<p>This information is interesting by itself, but this neglects my listening patterns over time. Let's look more into the time dimension.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step='2'>
			<p>This shows a cumulative plot of which artists I listened to over time. Hover over each line to see which artist it corresponds to!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step='2.1'>
			<p>Drake and J. Cole have a fairly consistent growth pattern.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step='2.2'>
			<p>Post Malone has a huge growth in late 2019. Why? <i>Hollywood's Bleeding</i> dropped at the start of September&mdash;makes perfect sense.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step='2.3'>
			<p>Juice WRLD has a prolific rise after passes away. Really wish I had listened to his music earlier; turns out his music is ðŸ”¥.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step='2.4'>
			<p>Maroon 5 has an insane increase to 25 hours in the matter of a few months. This happened toward the middle of quarantine when I was vibing with Maroon 5 on repeat. The almost vertical line captures just how much I listened to Adam Levine.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step" data-step='3'>
			<p>And that's it! There's still more interesting information in the data I didn't look at. For example, I chose only to look at the top 25 artists that I've listened to, leaving rich information behind, but that's for another day.
